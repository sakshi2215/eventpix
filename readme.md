# Event Photo Quality Management AI Software

This project focuses on the development of an AI-powered software tailored for event photos. The software enables photographers to upload event pictures and employs advanced AI algorithms to segregate low-quality photographs based on specific criteria, such as blurriness, duplication, closed eyes, optimal face angle, and head tilt detection.

## Photo Segregation Criteria

The system utilizes AI algorithms to identify and segregate low-quality photos based on the following criteria:

1. **Blurriness Detection:**
   Implement an algorithm to detect blurry images and separate them from clear, high-quality photos.

2. **Duplicate Image Identification:**
   Identify and remove duplicate images to maintain a clean and organized photo collection.

3. **Closed Eyes Detection:**
   Utilize facial recognition and eye detection to identify photos where subjects have closed eyes and flag them for review.

4. **Best Face Angle Detection:**
   Task focused on finding the optimal angle of a face in an image to enhance photo quality.

5. **Head Tilt Detection:**
   Measure the angle of the head in an image or video to ensure an optimal perspective.

6. **Emotion Detection:**
   The system shall be equipped to detect and categorize photos based on the emotions displayed by subjects.
   
This software aims to streamline the photo curation process, providing photographers with a tool to manage their event photo collections efficiently.
